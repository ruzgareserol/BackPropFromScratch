# BackPropFromScratch

This repository is focused on the implementation of the back propagation algorithm on multiple layered neural networks. The purpose is to perform a deep analysis 
on back propagation which is one of the most popular learning algorithms.
For this experimentation, time and computing power are not taken into consideration since the analysis is mainly constructed on the learing behaviour of the algorithm and the 
overall procedure of the learning phase.
To operate the file, just copy the .ipynb code into google colab and run it. You might have to send me an e-mail in order to obtain the dataset(ruzgareserols3(at)gmail.com).
To see the example output, just see the .pdf file
